**Link:** [Greatest Common Divisor of Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/greatest-common-divisor-of-strings/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)  

### Problem Statement
For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + t + t + ... + t + t (i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).

Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and str2.
